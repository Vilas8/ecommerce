Css best Practices.
1) Learn the css box model.

2) don't use chrome to debug css. Instead use Firefox.
   * Firefox devtools are far more superior than chrome.

3) Use flexbox to align items. Only single rows or columns.
   Eg: centering an element:
   .flex{
       display: flex:
       justify-content: center; x - axis
       align-items: center; Y - axis
   }

4) Use Grid to align items. 
   Grid allows you to work with multiple rows and columns.

   .grid{
    display: grid;
    grid-template-column:1fr 1fr 1fr; 3 columns
    grid-template-row: 1fr 1fr; 2-rows
    place-items: center; 
   }

5) When we are talking about Responsiveness 
   we are just thinking about changing the width of elements according to the size of screen.

   * This can be done using:
    # media queries.
      media queries might make you shoot yourself, when the projects grows larger.
    
   * Better way is to use:
     min max and clamp functions
     article{
        width: clamp(min, preferred, max)
     }

6) For video to maintain the aspect ratio use:
   video{
    width:100%;
    aspect-ratio:16/9;
   }

7) Standard width
   smartphones -  320px, 
   tablets   -    768px, 
   desktop -    1200px
