Best practices for writing html.
1) Make use of semantic tags
    EXAMPLE: <header> , <article> , <aside>, <footer> , <nav> etc
    WHY?
    --> It makes web pages more informative and adaptable, allowing browsers and search engines to better interpret content.

2) Always specify alt, width and height for images. and give meaningful alt

3) Avoid long lines. if it is long break it into smaller parts.
   eg: <img src="img/image.jpg"
            alt="image"
            width="200"
            height="300"

4) Avoid unneccessary Blank lines, Spaces and indentations

5) Using Consistent naming styles.

6) Use comments

7) Use Entities (https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_entities.asp)
   eg: © copyright use: &copy;
   they are characters are not found on computer keyboard such as:
   ¥ , €, ®  etc 
   non-breaking space   : 	&nbsp;

8) Always validate your code/
   * your code might not work properly 
   * Run it through a validator after writing a few lines of code.

   website for validation: https://validator.w3.org/nu/#file
   open the site --> Validate from direct input--> upload your html file and Run.

9) Check your code on multiple browsers.
   * Some tags are not support by a few browsers, So make sure to check whether you code works on 
     all the browsers and change the tags if needed.

10) Testing your apps.
    * learn the difference between unit, Integration and functional Testing.
    * tools: cypress, playwright, enzyme, Jest.
